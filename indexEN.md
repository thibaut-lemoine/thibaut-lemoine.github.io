([French Version](https://thibaut-lemoine.github.io/index.html))

## Status

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Centre de Recherche en Informatique, Signal et Automatique de Lille (CRIStAL) under the responsibility of Rémi Bardenet. Beforehand, I worked from 2020 to 2022 at Institut de Recherche Mathématique Avancée (IRMA) of Université de Strasbourg, for the project "Geometry of quantum Hall states" of USIAS directed by Semyon Klevtsov. From 2016 to 2020, I was a PhD student in Laboratoire de Probabilités, Statistique et Modélisation (LPSM) of Sorbonne Université, under the direction of Thierry Lévy. A pdf version of my resume is available [here](/CV_EN.pdf).

## Research Interests

I am interested in the interactions between probability and geometry/algebra, mainly through the prism of physical models. Among the subjects I have worked on, there are the two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, the quantum Hall effect on complex manifolds, determinantal point processes, Brownian motions on Lie groups, asymptotic representation theory, free probability theory. Among the subjects I am interested in but are still work in progress, there are the random Kähler metrics, the quantum information theory, and conditioned stochastic processes on Lie groups/algebras.

## PhD Thesis

My [PhD thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03096870v1) was devoted to study asymptotic aspects of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. More precisely, considering the Yang--Mills measure on a compact orientable surface of genus greater or equal to 1, or a compact nonorientable surface of genus greater or equal to 2, I proved the convergence of its partition function with structure group U(N) or SU(N), using the character expansion of the heat kernel. In order to establish this convergence, I highlighted a class of highest weights that already appeared in works from Gross and Taylor (94) that I named 'almost flat highest weights', or AFHW, and that help getting a fine approximation of the Laplace operator on U(N) or SU(N) when N goes to infinity. I have later used these almost flat highest weights to compute the large N limit of Wilson loops for contractible simple loops on the underlying surface.
